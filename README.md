# Custom Terms of Use

This would be the some standard preamble. 
_By doing ... you agree ... and so on._
** that is displayed as soon as you hit the URL of the repo! **

Note that 
* we don't touch the lincese file.
* the actual license in this repo hasn't no nice header because I've created it manually. In addition, it's not complete!
* we can use **Markdown** to make this more readable
