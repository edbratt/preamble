# My Custom Terms of Use

_This could be used for a standard preamble... 
e.g. By doing ... you agree ... and so on._ 

**Those terms are displayed as soon as you hit the URL of the repo!**

Note that 
* we don't touch the lincese file.
* the actual license in this repo hasn't no nice header because I've created it manually. In addition, it's not complete!
* we can use **Markdown** to make this more readable
